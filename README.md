# Attendance System Using RFID and NodeMCU
Online Attendance System Using RFID and NodeMCU
This project is mainly coded in:
1. PHP(for functionality) which contains innerHTMl files  
2. HTML files for different pages.
3. Image sources 

I have used my college logo, you can use your college logo if you want.
## Note:
While Navigating you may see that clicking on Attendance log or Add student, the php file for the required page will be downloaded, so in order to see seperate pages host the files on a local server like Xampp by placing the files in the `htdocs` folder in Xampp installation location.
You may use this blog as a guide for using Xampp to host pages [Xampp hosting guide](https://www.hostinger.in/tutorials/how-to-use-xampp-wordpress/)
For the NodeMCU files required for the working of hardware is uploaded at this [Git Repository]()
